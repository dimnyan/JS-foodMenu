This JavaScript project aims to create an interactive menu selector and change calculator. 
The user will be able to input their starting balance, choose a menu item, and receive information about the change they should receive.

Key Features:

1. Input Balance: The user will be prompted to enter their initial balance. This value will be used to calculate the change later on.

2. Menu Selection: The menu options will be defined as an object, where each key represents a menu item and the corresponding value represents its price.

3. Display Menu: The menu options will be displayed to the user, allowing them to choose their desired item.

4. Validate Input: The program will handle input validation to ensure the user selects a valid menu item and provides a valid balance.

5. Calculate Change: Once the user selects a menu item, the program will calculate the change by subtracting the menu item price from the initial balance.

6. Display Change: The program will display the calculated change to the user, indicating the amount and denomination of each coin or bill.
